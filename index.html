  <p>
    Well, where to begin!. My name is Ken. I am originally from Oklahoma, but now live in Oregon. I have never done anything with computers at all, but I am actually having a lot of fun learning this here with this great group of people. Before this I was in the military, multiple branches, and have always been in the medical field. I am happily married and have two amazing daughters! I hope this gives you a little information about me and, well, maybe we can be friends!
